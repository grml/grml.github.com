        <p><a href="http://grml.org/">Grml</a> - the bootable Linux live system
        (Live-CD) based on Debian - is an active <em>open source project</em>,
        available since 2003 and used by <em>tens of thousands of
        users</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>We need your help!</strong> Driven by a <a
        href="http://grml.org/team/">small team</a> of people in their free
        time, we can't get as much stuff done as we'd like to. If Grml saved
        your ass and want to give something back to the Grml project, this
        website will get you started.</p>

        <span class="label important">Important</span> Don't be afraid of us.
        You might think that you're not experienced enough to contribute to
        Grml (or any other open source project). But let us tell you otherwise:
        By using Grml and arriving at this page, you are highly likely to have
        a skill-set matching our needs. Early contributions tend to be small
        and minor ones, but can be a first step to becoming an open source
        developer. So no matter how small you may think your contribution is,
        it really <em>does matter to us</em>! Don't be shy, let's make Grml
        an even better kick-ass solution!

        <p>Grml joined the Github party, all our repositories are available at
        <a href="http://github.com/grml/">github.com/grml</a>. If you already
        have a Github account it's really simple to contribute.

        <p><span class="label notice">Notice</span>: while it makes it easier
        for both sides, there really is no need to have a Github account. We
        even run a copy of all the Github stuff on our <a
        href="http://git.grml.org/">own infrastructure</a>. But social coding
        rocks!</p>

        <p>So, how to get started?</p>

        <ul>

         <li>You already have a patch? Go straight towards <a href="#upstream">
         Getting your work upstream</a></li>.

         <li>You already have a repository and want to create a patch from it?
         Check out <a href="#patch">how to create a patch</a></li>

         <li>Already know which repository to work with? Skip over to <a
         href="#fork">Fork!</a></li>

         <li>Not sure where to find the apropriate sources? Just <a
         href="#identify">read on...</a></li>

        <section id="identify"></a>
        <div class="page-header">
        <h2>Identifying the appropriate Git repository</h2>
        </div>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/grml">Soooo many Git repositories</a>,
        you might ask where to start? We are here to help you!</p>

        <p>Grml's project homepage is available as <a
          href="https://github.com/grml/grml.org">git repository</a>. If you
        found a typo, feel the desparate need to fix our <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denglisch">denglish</a>, or work on
        our documentation that's the right place to start.</p>

        <p>If you are also a huge fan of Zsh, Vim, Screen and Tmux and want to
        pimp their configs the <a
          href="git://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core.git">grml-etc-core</a>
        repository is where the music plays.</p>

        <p>You're already enjoying your own live system based on Grml?
        Fantastic! Don't forget to check out <a
          href="http://github.com/grml/grml-live">grml-live</a>.</p>

        <p>Now let's visit the machine room. The boot process of Grml starts
        with the Linux kernel, which includes patches and configuration found in
        <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml-kernel">the grml-kernel
          repository</a>. After that, the initramfs takes over. It's driven by
        <a href="https://github.com/grml/live-boot-grml">live-boot-grml</a>.
        Once the initramfs stage is finished, the main boot-up process featured
        in <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml-autoconfig">grml-autoconfig</a>
        takes over. live-boot-grml and grml-autoconfig are also the place where
        all the nifty Grml <a href="http://grml.org/cheatcodes/">boot
          options</a> are implemented at.</p>

        <p>A simple frontend to set up booting via network (PXE) is known as <a
          href="https://github.com/grml/grml-terminalserver">grml-terminalserver</a>.</p>

        <p>To get your live system onto a USB thumb drive, <a
          href="https://github.com/grml/grml2usb">grml2usb</a> is waiting for
        you.</p>

        <p><span class="label notice">Notice</span>: none of the described
        repositories match your needs? Either go through <a
          href="https://github.com/grml">the repository list</a> and try to spot the
        appropriate repository or just <a href="#contact">talk to us</a>.</p>

        <section id="fork"></a>
        <div class="page-header">
        <h2>Fork!</h2>
        </div>

        <p>You <a href="#identify">identified the correct Git repository</a>?
        Great! The easiest way to play with the repository is by choosing the
        'Fork' feature at the right side of the upper screen:</p>

        <ul class="media-grid">
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core">
              <img class="thumbnail" src="img/fork.png" alt="Screenshot of Fork button at Github" />
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>This should give you your own copy of the Git repository and you can
        commit to it without even asking us for permission. Then you can simply
        <a href="#patch">create a patch</a>.

        <p>You don't have a Github account (yet)? You can grab the Git
        repository anyway. On the Github web page you can click on 'Git
        Read-Only'. Then clone the URL (being
        'git://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core.git' in the following screenshot):</p>

        <ul class="media-grid">
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core">
              <img class="thumbnail" src="img/clone.png" alt="Screenshot of Github repository cloning" />
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Check out the repository and explore it:</p>

<pre>
% git clone git://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core.git
% cd grml-etc-core</pre>

        </section>

        <section id="patch"></a>
        <div class="page-header">
        <h2>Create a patch</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Creating a patch is simple. Check out a new branch in your repository
        (to avoid messy commit history and conflicts possibly showing up in master):</p>

<pre>
% git checkout -b mygreatfeature</pre>

        <p>Implement your bugfix/feature and once you're happy about it, commit
        your work (replace $FILES with the files you changed):</p>

<pre>
% [hack hack hack]
% git add $FILES
% git commit -v</pre>

        <p>That's pretty much it. If you aren't familiar with Git yet and want
        to learn more, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a> has plenty
        of useful information.</p>

        <p>Finally, it would be great if you'd share your work with us!</p>

        </section>

        <section id="upstream"></a>
        <div class="page-header">
          <h2>Get your work upstream</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Getting your work into Grml isn't just about making Grml even hotter.
        It also has advantages for you! You get your features tested and
        maintained by the community, gain credit and get immediate builds of it
        served by our <a href="http://jenkins.grml.org/">awesome continuous
          integration lab</a>. Yay!</p>

        <p>If you chose to <a href="#fork">fork</a> the repository, all you've
        got to do is click on the 'Pull Request' button on your Github page:</p>

        <div class="span4">
          <ul class="media-grid">
            <li>
              <a href="http://grml.org/screenshots/">
                <img src="img/pull-request.png" alt="Screenshot of Github's pull-request button" />
              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>If you're interested in further documentation regarding pull
        requests, <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">head over
        to the Github page about pull requests</a>.

        <p>Don't have a Github account and/or prefer email? No worries.
        Just create a patch based on your work:</p>

<pre>
% git format-patch origin/master</pre>

        <p>Then send the created patch file(s) to bugs (at) grml.org. Either use
        your common mail client or, if you prefer, use Git itself:</p>

<pre>
% git send-email 000*.patch</pre>

        <section id="contact"></a>
        <div class="page-header">

        </div>

        <span class="label important">Important</span> If you're unsure about
        something (like which repository is the right one, if a particular bug
